## Return On Investment

**Initial Investment:** £160,000

**Cumulative EBITDA:**
- Year 1: £291,428
- Year 2: £1,125,961
- Year 3: £2,403,509

**ROI after 3 years:** 1,402% (£2,403,509 ÷ £160,000 × 100%)
**Payback Period:** 7 months

## Risk Factors

1. **Utilization Assumptions:** The forecast assumes rapid customer adoption. If utilization rates are 25% lower than projected, EBITDA would decrease by approximately 35-40%.

2. **Price Sensitivity:** The pricing strategy assumes customers in Hatch End will accept premium pricing. Market research should validate this assumption.

3. **Competition:** New competitors entering the market could impact both utilization and pricing.

4. **Equipment Downtime:** Specialized equipment failures could significantly impact revenue if replacement/repair timeframes are lengthy.

5. **Regulatory Changes:** Changes in regulations around IV therapy or other treatments could impact operations.

## Conclusion

Based on these assumptions, the longevity business shows strong profit potential with an attractive ROI. The business could become profitable within the first year of operations, with significant profitability in years 2 and 3. The break-even point of 14 daily customers appears achievable given the service mix and target market.

Key to success will be:
- Achieving the projected utilization rates through effective marketing
- Maintaining premium pricing strategy
- Managing variable costs (particularly supplies)
- Building a membership base for recurring revenue
- Delivering exceptional customer experience to drive retention and referrals

While the projections show very strong returns, a more conservative approach would be prudent for initial financial planning, perhaps assuming 20% lower utilization rates in the early months.
